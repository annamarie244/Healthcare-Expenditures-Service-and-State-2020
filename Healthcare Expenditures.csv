"Notes"
"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the Actuary produces Health Expenditures by State of Residence and Health Expenditures by State of Provider every five years. The State Health Expenditure Accounts are a subcomponent of the National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA), the official government estimates of health spending in the United States.  "
""
"All health spending is displayed in millions of dollars. Data may not sum to totals due to rounding. "

"Definitions"
"*Hospital Care*: Covers all services provided by hospitals to patients and that are billed by the hospital. These include room and board, ancillary charges, services of resident physicians, inpatient pharmacy, hospital-based nursing home and home health care, and any other services billed by hospitals in the United States. The value of hospital services is measured by total net revenue, which equals gross patient revenues (charges) less contractual adjustments, bad debts, and charity care. It also includes government tax appropriations as well as non-patient and non-operating revenues."
""
"*Physician and Other Professional Services*: Covers services provided in establishments operated by Doctors of Medicine (M.D.) and Doctors of Osteopathy (D.O.), outpatient care centers, plus the portion of medical laboratories services that are billed independently by the laboratories. This category also includes services rendered by a doctor of medicine (M.D.) or doctor of osteopathy (D.O.) in hospitals, if the physician bills independently for those services. Clinical services provided in freestanding outpatient clinics operated by the U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the U.S. Indian Health Service are also included, as well as services provided in establishments operated by health practitioners other than physicians and dentists. These professional services include those provided by private-duty nurses, chiropractors, podiatrists, optometrists, and physical, occupational and speech therapists, among others."
""
"*Prescription Drugs and Other Non-Durable Medical Products*: Covers retail sales of human-use dosage-form drugs, biological drugs, and diagnostic products that are available only by a prescription. Also includes sales of non-prescription drugs (products purchased over the counter such as analgesics and cough and allergy medications) and medical sundries (items such as surgical and medical instruments and surgical dressings, and diagnostic products such as needles and thermometers)."
""
"*Nursing Home Care*: Covers nursing and rehabilitative services provided in freestanding nursing home facilities. These services are generally provided for an extended period of time by registered or licensed practical nurses and other staff. Care received in state and local government facilities and nursing facilities operated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are also included."
""
"*Dental Services*: Covers services provided in establishments operated by a Doctor of Dental Medicine (D.M.D.) or Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.) or a Doctor of Dental Science (D.D.Sc.)."
""
"*Home Health Care*: Covers medical care provided in the home by freestanding home health agencies (HHAs). Medical equipment sales or rentals not billed through HHAs and non-medical types of home care (e.g., Meals on Wheels, chore-worker services, friendly visits, or other custodial services) are excluded."
""
"*Medical Durables*: Covers retail sales of items such as contact lenses, eyeglasses and other ophthalmic products, surgical and orthopedic products, hearing aids, wheelchairs, and medical equipment rentals."
""
"*Other Health, Residential, and Personal Care*: This category includes spending for Medicaid home and community based waivers, care provided in residential care facilities, ambulance services, school health and worksite health care. Generally these programs provide payments for services in non-traditional settings such as community centers, senior citizens centers, schools, and military field stations. The residential establishments are classified as facilities for the intellectually disabled, and mental health and substance abuse facilities. The ambulance establishments are classified as Ambulance services."
""
"*Total*: Total health care expenditures include spending for all privately and publicly funded personal health care services and products (hospital care, physician services, nursing home care, prescription drugs, etc.) by state of residence. Hospital spending is included and reflects the total net revenue (gross charges less contractual adjustments, bad debts, and charity care). Costs such as insurance program administration, research, and construction expenses are not included in this total."
