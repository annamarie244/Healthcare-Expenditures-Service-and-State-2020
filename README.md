# Healthcare-Expenditures-Service-and-State-2020

#Introduction
  I am looking at healthcare data from the year 2020, I have it broken down by service for each state. I am comparing the total healthcare expenditures for each state and then the total expenditures for specific services for the state of North Carolina. Recently working in healthcare I have learned about the importance of access to quality primary care services. Increasing the quality and access to primary care can increase peoples health and keep them out of the hospitals. Keeping people healthy and out of the hospital will lower the total expenditures.
